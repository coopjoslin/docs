<h2>Notes</h2>
- **Masked login URL: https://meridian.org/sdmqwkudyruvtifgubgh/**
- This site makes extensive use of the REST API, so I can't disable it without compromising some functionality.
- We'll need to figure out PHP 8 migration sometime this year (2024).
- This site has 20-something subsites. Be careful with DNS changes.
 
<h3>Frequent issues & how to solve them</h3>

<h4>Image formatting is wrong</h4>
<p>This site's custom theme handled images poorly, so we've had to revise those as issues crop up.</p>
